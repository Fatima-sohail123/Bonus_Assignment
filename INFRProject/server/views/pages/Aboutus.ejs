            <p>Helloooooo everyone, welcome to The Happy Farm. We're a local farm in Ontario that thought, "Hmm, there are too many 
                pesticides used in farming nowadays." These pesticides cause hormonal imbalances and health issues in people. 
                That's why I decided to start my own farmâ€”to help the people in Ontario eat healthy fruits and veggies without worrying 
                about whether their food will cause health issues.

            <p>Our fruits and veggies are grown in the finest blend of nutrient-rich soil packed with calcium from eggshells that we get 
                from our neighboring farm. Eggshells are known to have calcium, which enriches the soil and helps the plants grow.

            <p>Our produce is hand-picked by our farmers, contributing to the fight against global warming. To help more people get jobs, 
                we also hire people from around our community to help pick the fruits and veggies. As payment, they get free fruits and 
                veggies along with their normal pay.
